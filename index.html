		<h1>Me in 33 Seconds</h1>

		<p>When I have the time, I'm going to write a really awesome pitch here.</p>

		<p>I'll talk about my best accomplishment and why it's a good time to hire me now.</p>

		<p>I'll briefly mention the skills I have and explain why I'd be a great hire for the right kind of business.</p>

		<p>Essentially, this is like a cover letter online.</p>
