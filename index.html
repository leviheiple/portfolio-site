		<h1>Me in 93 Seconds</h1>

		<p>My name is Levi Heiple. I'm a professional writer of 4+ years looking for an opportunity to begin a web development career.</p>

		<p>After getting laid off from my last job, I realized there just wasn't a good market for my existing skill set. So rather than moping about, I figured it was time to retool. I locked myself in my room for 3 weeks and taught myself basic HTML, CSS, SQL and JavaScript. Thankfully, my wife prepared enough food for me so that I didn't die.</p>

		<p>I always enjoy learning new things. My wife can attest that I buy too many books on a variety of topics from economics, education, personal finance, management/leadership, psychology/counseling, creativity, productivity, and everything in between. Simply "doing the work" isn't enough for me. I like to understand problems at the root level and try to come up with better solutions.</p>

		<p>My past experience as a copywriter means I am comfortable working directly with panicked clients and meeting "need it yesterday" kind of deadlines. I take a "minimum viable product" approach to solving problems: make sure it's right before it's perfect... and get it out fast.</p>

		<p>My friends and family see me as a problem solver. Even before I had any real tech skills, people from my church would pay me (cold hard cash) to fix their computer problems simply because I had the patience to Google things and interpret technical documentation.</p>

		<p>My 3+ years of experience working with search engine marketing and SEO has given me the ability to blend technical analysis with human communication and empathy.</p>

		<p>See my portfolio for a demonstration of my tech skills. I'm currently enrolled in Udacity's Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree program... so my skills are growing by the day.</p>

		<p>Thanks</p>
