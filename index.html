		<h1>Me in 61 Seconds</h1>

		<p>My name is Levi Heiple. I am a writer looking to start a new career in web development. </p>

		<p>I taught myself basic Python, HTML, and CSS in 2 weeks. I am currently in the process of learning SQL, JavaScript, AJAX, and more via the “Full Stack Web Developor Nanodegree” from Udacity. (See my resume for details.)</p>

		<p>Today’s economy is rapidly changing. Companies who stay ahead of the technology curve hire employees who are adaptable and can quickly absorb new technical information. If this is what you’re after, then any one of my references can verify that I fit the bill.</p>

		<p>If you’re a company looking for a young developer who loves to learn and is sensitive to the need for <em>clear communication</em> and <em>concise code,</em> then you may want to consider hiring me.</p>

		<p>There are certain advantages to hiring a candidate with a writing background. As Jason Fried, co-founder of Basecamp (creators of Ruby on Rails), put it:</p>

		<blockquote><em>“Hire the better writer… That's because being a good writer is about more than writing. <strong>Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking.</strong> Great writers know how to communicate. They make things <strong>easy to understand.</strong> They can put themselves in <strong>someone else's shoes.</strong> They <strong>know what to omit.</strong> And those are qualities you want in any candidate.”</em></blockquote>

		<p>As a writer/marketer, I approach work from a problem-centered perspective. Unlike some developers who only want to use a few specific skills, I’m willing to expand my skill set to meet the demands of the problem.</p>

		<p>If you think a person like myself would be a valuable addition to your team, please get back to me ASAP. I’m ready to start my new career immediately and intend to join the first company that fits my criteria.</p>

		<p>Thanks</p>
